# Power BI and MySQL Data Analysis Project

## Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze business performance using MySQL for data preparation and Power BI for data visualization. The dataset includes information on sales, products, customers, and regions, which is processed to extract actionable business insights.

## Objectives

The analysis focuses on addressing the following key questions:

1. **Sales Analysis**:  
   - What are the total sales by region, product, and customer type?  
   - How have sales trends evolved over time?

2. **Customer Insights**:  
   - Who are the top customers contributing to revenue?  
   - What is the customer retention rate?

3. **Product Insights**:  
   - Which products are the most and least profitable?  
   - Are there regional patterns in product sales?

4. **Performance Metrics**:  
   - What is the overall profit margin?  
   - How do performance metrics vary across departments?

## Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction and Preparation
   - Extracted raw data from the MySQL database.  
   - Cleaned and transformed data using SQL queries to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
   - Exported the prepared dataset for visualization in Power BI.

### 2. Data Import and Modeling
   - Imported the cleaned data into Power BI.  
   - Established relationships between tables for seamless analysis.  
   - Defined calculated measures (e.g., Total Sales, Profit Margin) using DAX functions.

### 3. Visualization and Dashboard Creation
   - Designed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as revenue trends, product performance, and regional sales.  
   - Incorporated slicers for filtering data by date, region, and product category.  

### 4. Insights and Validation
   - Derived actionable insights from the visualizations.  
   - Validated results with raw data to ensure accuracy.

## Key Insights

- **Regional Performance**:  
  The western region consistently leads in sales, while the northern region boasts higher profit margins.  

- **Top Products**:  
  Products X and Y are the primary revenue drivers, whereas Product Z underperforms across all regions.  

- **Customer Trends**:  
  20% of customers generate 80% of the revenue, aligning with the Pareto principle.  

- **Seasonality**:  
  Sales peak during the holiday season, highlighting a strong seasonal effect.

## Final Deliverable

The Power BI dashboard provides a holistic view of business performance with the following features:

- **Dynamic Filters**: Interactive slicers to filter data by time, region, and product.  
- **Key Metrics**: Visualized revenue, profit, and sales trends.  
- **Customer Insights**: Segmentation of top customers by revenue contribution.  
- **Product Analysis**: Identification of high and low-performing products.
